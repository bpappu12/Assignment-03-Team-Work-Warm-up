"# Assignment-03-Team-Work-Warm-up" 

Assignment requirements:

1. Work in pairs.

2. Discuss design of scrolling shooter game, generating at least informal diagrams, and what to remove, change, extend, add, etc. to create a simple game framework with a controllable player character chased by a non-player character.

3. Maintain one Github public repository to share work together.

4. Decide on some combination of "pair programming" or a division of labor -- however works for your schedule, etc. and analyze this process to comment in your submission pdf.  (Part of this assignment is to think about what works well and what does not through the process of working with others).

 

Software requirements:

1. Generate a movable player character and "seeking" non-player character on at least a static background (such as a black screen).

2. Build upon the scrolling shooter code base, using the design patterns in place (observer, ecs, simple factory).

2. The player character should have horizontal and vertical controls at a minimum.

3. The non-player character should move toward the player character.

All other specifications your pair may generate as desired.

 

Suggested "objectives exceeded / check-plus" extensions:

1. Animated sprites.

2. Moving background.

3. Diagonal controls.

4. Other game features (particularly ones that might build toward a Gauntlet-style dungeon crawler).

5. UML diagrams (structural and/or behavioral).

 

Submit:

1. Individually authored pdf that documents how your pair worked (with specific comments on contributions), your design ideas/diagrams, your specifications, and an overall analysis of your final code.

2. Submit a screen recording of your working game play.

3. Submit the link to your repository.

4. Be prepared to present a code review over Zoom on the due date.
